## 📋 Overview

This system automates the process of generating exam seating arrangements by applying predefined rules and constraints. Developed as an academic mini-project, it demonstrates practical problem-solving approaches to a common institutional challenge.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Automated seat allocation based on roll numbers
- ✅ Room capacity constraint handling
- ✅ Interactive GUI for easy operation
- ✅ Clean HTML output for printing and distribution
- ✅ Rule-based logic engine

---

## 🎯 Project Scope

This academic utility focuses on:

- **Automation** - Eliminates manual seating arrangement creation
- **Constraint Satisfaction** - Respects room capacity and distribution rules
- **User Experience** - Simple GUI for non-technical users
- **Output Quality** - Professional HTML-formatted seating charts

> **Note:** This is an academic prototype designed for learning purposes, not a production-ready enterprise system.

    A[Input Data] --> B[Rule Engine]
    B --> C[Constraint Validation]
    C --> D[Seat Allocation]
    D --> E[HTML Output]
```

1. **Input Phase** - Student data and exam details are provided
2. **Processing** - Rule-based logic assigns seats respecting constraints
3. **Validation** - System ensures no conflicts or violations
4. **Output** - Generates formatted seating arrangement
5. **Export** - HTML file ready for printing/distribution
